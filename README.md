Red project number one: Two week project over first two weeks of course

HTML tags and trees. Lots of learning during this project about when to use headings, not to use IDs if at all possible, and to use classes and sections. Use format tool to keep your work neat and readable. Leave notes for yourself and others who may need to understand what you have done.


CSS files are impressive. Having a separate folder for them makes so much sense. Styling is complex and I am beginning to use what I am learning about flex-box. Lots of trial and error helped to figure out/understand how things work. I put a staggering amount of hours into completing this project but learned a lot by doing. Hoping to get faster as I learn more.



Java Script is still a very new concept to me. I will need lots more practice to really understand how to write my statements. For this project, I am beginningto understand the general concepts.
