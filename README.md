# Aloha 

Red project number one: a two week project over first two weeks of our Web Dev course.

HTML tags and trees. Lots of learning during this project about when to use headings, not to use IDs if at all possible, and to use classes and sections. Learned to use the format tool to keep my work neat and readable. Left notes to myself and potential later, for others who could need to understand what I have done.


CSS files are impressive. Having a separate folder for them makes so much sense. Styling is complex and I am beginning to use what I am learning about flex-box. Lots of trial and error helped to figure out/understand how things work. I put a staggering amount of hours into completing this project but learned a lot by doing so. Hoping to get faster as I learn more and get a better depth of understanding of using flexbox and the child/parent commands.



Java Script is still a very new concept to me. I will need lots more practice to really understand how to write my statements. For this project, I only am beginning to understand the general concepts.
